Project Title: 10 Days Diary

Group Members:
  Erin Cargin: Co-Project Manager, Art Director, Senior Developer
  McGregor Koenig: Co-Project Manager, Senior Developer

Problem Statement: We intend to create a diary software to encourage self-reflection and
personal growth in the user. We also aim to provide a method for mental health professionals to
keep an eye on the mental states of their patients in a non-intrusive manner.

Project Scope: We will encourage users to fill out a diary entry each day for ten days. They will
be prompted to answer questions such as “What was something good that happened today?” or
“What are you looking forward to tomorrow?” or other similar questions. At the end of the ten
days, users will be prompted to reflect on their growth that has been facilitated by their daily
self-reflection. Mental health professionals will be able to send connection requests to individual
users using their unique user ID, which the user will then be able to accept. Mental health
professionals will be able to see all of their clients’s entries, bridging the gap between sessions
and providing insight into the daily lives of their clients. Users are free to use the app without a
mental health professional as well.

Technologies: We plan to use C++ in Visual Studio using the Windows API. We may also use a
no-code app maker to create an android or IOS version of our software. We also plan to use
GitHub/GitLab for repository management.

Project Justification: This project will facilitate easier and more consistent communication
between mental health professionals and their clients. It will also improve the lives of users by
encouraging self-reflection and personal growth.
