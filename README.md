# Problem Statement
  We intend to create a diary software to encourage self-reflection and personal growth in the user. We also aim to provide a method for mental health professionals to keep an eye on the mental states of their patients in a non-intrusive manner. Project Scope: We will encourage users to fill out a diary entry each day for ten days. They will be prompted to answer questions such as “What was something good that happened today?” or “What are you looking forward to tomorrow?” or other similar questions. At the end of the ten days, users will be prompted to reflect on their growth that has been facilitated by their daily self-reflection. Mental health professionals will be able to send connection requests to individual users using their unique user ID, which the user will then be able to accept. Mental health professionals will be able to see all of their clients’s entries, bridging the gap between sessions and providing insight into the daily lives of their clients. Users are free to use the app without a  mental health professional as well.

# Project Justification
This project will facilitate easier and more consistent communication between mental health professionals and their clients. It will also improve the lives of users by encouraging self-reflection and personal growth.
